Installation
============

Blackchirp is a cross-platform program, though at present it has only been tested on the Linux distribution openSUSE 15.2+. If the program does not behave as expected on other platforms, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/kncrabtree/blackchirp/issues).

Requirements
------------

- Compiler with C++17 support (e.g., gcc 7+)
