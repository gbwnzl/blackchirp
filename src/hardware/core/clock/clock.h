/**
 * @brief The Clock class defines an interface for an oscillator
 *
 * Unlike most other HardwareObjects, BlackChirp expects to have multiple clocks.
 * As a result, the constructor of the clock needs to receive information about
 * which clock this is for the purpose of identifying it in QSettings.
 *
 * Also unlike most other HardwareObjects, the role of a particular clock can be
 * configured at runtime. This allows for a single hardware implementation (e.g.,
 * the Valon5009) to be used for different purposes across instruments without
 * needing to write separate code.
 *
 * The Clock class keeps track of which role(s) it serves; 1 role per output.
 * It also tells the ClockManager whether it is tunable and what its allowed
 * frequency range is (though the range itself is defined in its implementation).
 *
